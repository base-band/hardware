#    Per FPGA compiled c/asm/hex override section
#    This tb allows for overriding the compiled code of any FPGA
#    simply set as many of (OVERRIDE_CS20_C, ...) to a value and 
#    create the corresponding folder in the ./override folder
#    include makefile_sim_verialtor.mk afterwards and it's all good to go
#    
#    The override folder mirrors the structure of higgs_sdr_rev2. This Makefile
#    is only compatible with Grav3.
#

# Set as many of these as you want, setting to 0 does not disable, you must
# comment. If you are NOT overriding a particular FPGA, the QENGINE_LITE setting
# below must match what the FPGA has set inside fpga_top.sv
